Next: Google Publisher Restrictions
We are in the process of migrating and consolidating all of the Google Publisher Policies and Google Publisher Restrictions to the new Publisher Policies Help Centre. For now, you can still view all of the policies in the AdMob, AdSense and Ad Manager Help Centres. 
When you monetise your content with Google ad code that you are required to adhere to the following policies. Failure to comply with these policies may result in Google blocking ads from appearing against your content, or suspending or terminating your account.

These policies apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products.

Google helps to enable a free of cost and open internet by helping publishers monetise their content and advertisers reach prospective customers with useful, relevant products and services. Maintaining trust in the ads ecosystem requires setting limits on what we will monetise.

Google Publisher Policies are organised into the following categories:
