Tips for the Spam policies for Google web search
To ensure a good experience for users and advertisers, Google publishers are required to adhere to the Spam policies for Google web search. Following these policies will help you avoid negative experiences for your users, and reduce the chance of misleading advertisers. The policies are quite extensive so we’ve highlighted some important information below:

Avoid unnecessary, repeated use of keywords, which don’t add value to the site.
Your sites should not claim that they provide content or services that they do not have.
Don’t create 'doorway' pages created just for search engines, or other 'cookie cutter' approaches such as affiliate programmes with little or no original content.
Please keep in mind that participation in Google advertising programmes doesn't affect a site's rank in Google search results and won't queue its web pages for crawling by our main index bots. Publishers wishing to improve their ranking in the search results should visit the Google Search Essentials and Search Console, which are available to all publishers.

Sites that violate the Spam policies for Google web search may be omitted from Google search results, as well as having Google-served ads disabled under this policy. If this has happened to one of your sites, you can modify your site so that it does comply with the policies and then submit your site for reconsideration.
